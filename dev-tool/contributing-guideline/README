CMath contributing guidline
===========================

how to start?? [BE AN OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTOR]

> Well, it is easier than you think! You can start contributing in two ways.
  Creating a new function or debugging an existing version. Our project is 
  focused on quantity over complexity. It is possible that some of our methods 
  are less efficient. So feel free to edit and make an efficient version or if 
  you have an equation in your mind which you think will be beneficial for c 
  developers, then create a new file and start contributing! Now follow next step
  to modify / create and submit your contribution.
  

How to modify / create and submit contribution?

> *** Before starting any contribution please follow our programming standard (link 
  below) and code of conduct (link below)!
  
  If you are modifying any pre-exising code, keep in mind that you also need to follow
  the naming convention and commenting style.
  STEPS:
  first go to the file you want to modify and press the pencil icon [Edit this file] 
  on top right corner >> modify the code >> press [Propose changes] on the bottom >> 
  [Create pull request] >> in the write section type the modifications you have made 
  and why? (include as much as details to help us understand your modification) also 
  type your name (optional) >> [Create pull request]
  
  For creating a new equation, first go inside of the branch (e.g. geometry) folder
  and >> on the top press [Add file] >> [Create new file] >> and submit your code >>
  and then submit a pull request [read above].
  
Before pressing [Create pull request]
  - Test your program on your own environment or any online C compiler.
  - check edge cases, make your code is safe.
  - make a test in main(void) or create a test method to test your method.
  - finally check if there is anything which is violation the CMath programming
    standard.
