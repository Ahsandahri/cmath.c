CMath contributing guidline
===========================

how to start??
  Well, it is easier than you think! You can start contributing in two ways.
  Creating a new function or debugging an existing version. Our project is 
  focused on quantity over complexity. It is possible that some of our methods 
  are less efficient. So feel free to edit and make an efficient version or if 
  you have an equation in your mind which you think will be beneficial for c 
  developers, then create a new file and start contributing! Now follow next step
  to modify / create and submit your contribution.
